                <p>
                    I’m a dedicated Software Engineer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, holding a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia Okanagan. My experience spans across various roles, including working as a Retail Sales Associate at Marshalls, where I honed my customer service skills, and as a Delivery Driver for Instacart, where I ensured timely and accurate deliveries while maintaining high customer satisfaction.
                    My technical journey includes developing a privacy-focused video-sharing service using Django and AWS during my capstone project, creating a Reddit clone with a team using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and PHP, and building a responsive personal portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I've also gained practical experience through a front-end role at Costco Wholesale, where I contributed to sales and customer interactions.
                    I’m passionate about building web applications and coding video games, and I’m always eager to enhance my skills and knowledge. My hobbies include practicing martial arts, exercising, playing video games, and spending quality time with friends, family, and my dog. Whether it's solving complex problems or engaging in collaborative projects, I thrive in environments where I can apply my technical skills and contribute to meaningful outcomes.
